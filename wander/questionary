My passion for development and engineering has been a driving force in my career since childhood. Through formal education and hands-on experience, I have developed a strong foundation in both software and hardware development. The thrill of creating something new and the satisfaction of seeing my work succeed are what truly motivate me. My dedication to excellence is reflected in the positive feedback I have received from family, friends, colleagues, and mentors. To me, being great means not only possessing exceptional technical skills but also fostering personal growth and contributing positively to any team or organization.

We have an async culture here. How do you feel about it?
I am very comfortable with an asynchronous work culture. My ability to work independently and manage my time effectively makes me well-suited to this type of environment. I believe that asynchronous work can lead to increased productivity and flexibility, as long as there are clear communication channels and expectations.

We value autonomy at our company. Would you say you thrive in a self-managed environment?
My ability to thrive in a self-managed environment has been a core part of my professional identity since my early days as an intern. Working on projects like hackathons and freelancing opportunities has further reinforced my skills in independent work. While I value collaboration and communication, I am confident in my ability to work effectively with minimal supervision.

Our team works remotely. Have you had experience with remote work, and if so, how was it for you?
I have extensive experience working remotely in various locations, including Brazil, the United States, and Israel. Collaborating with teams across different time zones has honed my ability to effectively manage my workload, communicate clearly, and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. While I appreciate the occasional in-person interactions, I believe that remote work offers significant benefits for both productivity and work-life balance.

Travel is a big part of our company culture. Could you share some of your favorite travel experiences?
Travel has always been a passion of mine, and I enjoy exploring new places and experiencing different cultures. While I haven't had the opportunity to travel outside of Brazil yet, I have had the pleasure of discovering many beautiful destinations within my own country. Recently, I embarked on a solo trip to Florian√≥polis, where I enjoyed relaxing on the beaches, exploring the city, and purchasing a new car. Driving my new car back home for over 1,000 kilometers was a truly unforgettable experience.

My primary workstation is a high-performance Windows computer equipped with a Ryzen 7 5800X@5.0GHz processor, a RTX 3070Ti SC, 2x16GB of 4000mhz ram and plenty of fast pci-e gen4 SSD storage, with some on RAID configurations. To complement my main setup, I also utilize a Steam Deck and a laptop running Linux, as well as a self-hosted NAS. I maintain a clean and organized workspace, minimizing distractions and creating a conducive environment for focused work.

I approach challenging problems with a methodical and objective mindset. By analyzing tasks from multiple perspectives, I strive to identify the most effective solutions and overcome any obstacles that may arise. This approach allows me to maintain a clear focus and find innovative ways to address complex challenges.

Politics can often influence workplace dynamics. What are your thoughts on political discussions at work?
I believe that while politics can be a relevant topic, it is important to maintain a professional and respectful workplace environment. I generally avoid discussing political matters during work hours, unless they are directly related to the job at hand. In my previous role, where politics was a relevant aspect of our work, discussions were kept professional and focused on the specific tasks and projects involved.

Everyone has their own idea of a perfect job. What does your ideal relationship with work look like?
My ideal work relationship is one where I can continuously learn and grow, both personally and professionally. I value a collaborative environment where I can share knowledge and expertise with my colleagues, fostering a culture of mutual respect and open-mindedness. I believe that a positive work environment is essential for achieving both individual and team success.

I am motivated to contribute my skills and expertise to a company that values my contributions and offers opportunities for personal and professional development.

A day in the life tells us a lot. Could you describe what a typical workday looks like for you?
A typical workday for me begins with a healthy breakfast and a brief workout to energize my mind and body. I stay updated on current events, connect with friends and family, and explore my interests to maintain a well-rounded perspective. This morning routine helps me feel refreshed and prepared to tackle the day's challenges.
Once I'm at work, I prioritize a structured approach, incorporating techniques like the Pomodoro Technique to optimize my productivity. Taking regular breaks and ensuring a healthy work-life balance are essential for sustaining my focus and preventing burnout. After completing my tasks, I prioritize relaxation and quality time with loved ones to recharge and prepare for the next day.

Weekends are important for balance. What does a normal Saturday look like for you?
I typically spend my weekends enjoying quality time with loved ones, exploring local attractions, or trying new activities. Whether it's a leisurely outing to a park, a visit to a new restaurant, or indulging in thrilling experiences like amusement parks or go-karting, I prioritize activities that allow me to connect with others, pursue my hobbies, and expand my cultural horizons.
